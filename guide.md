4. Remove plate from the top of the **equatorial wedge** and screw it into the **body**. Screw both knobs securely. <br>

5. Slide the back of the plate referenced in the last step into the **equatorial wedge** until the stopper on the plate is in contact with the equatorial wedge. <br>

> ⚠️ *Ensure that the black lens cap faces you <br>*
  ⚠️ *Ensure that the large lower knob of the **equatorial wedge** faces North. Use a compass to confirm this.* <br>

### Polar Alignment
Polar Alignment refers to the procedure for aligning Star Adventurer 2i’s rotational axis with the Earth’s rotational axis. 
If we extend Earth’s rotational axis out into space it intersects an imaginary point called the Celestial Pole.
Because the celestial poles are imaginary points, there is nothing to see at their locations. 
However, Polaris orbits this point in the northern hemisphere. 
The circle in the reticle is the orbit of Polaris around the celestial pole so the goal of this alignment is to get Polaris in the correct point on that circle. <br>
1. Find your latitude using an app like PS Align Pro or a website like [GPS Coordinates](https://gps-coordinates.org/)
2. Move the large knob of the equatorial wedge until the arrow aligns with your latitude. Note that each line is 3 degrees each. <br> ![Screenshot 2023-09-13 154705](https://github.com/gabydaemon/StarAdventurer/assets/28716512/0264c16c-6bf3-4c8a-bd49-67c1e49fc644)
3. Locate Polaris
   1. Using Stellarium smartphone app (any planetarium app can be used)
      1. Search Polaris in the search bar
   2. Using the sky
      1. Find the big dipper
      2. The two stars on the end of the Dipper's "cup" point the way to Polaris. <br> ![dip1](https://github.com/gabydaemon/StarAdventurer/assets/28716512/32eebeb9-07c3-4a19-83bb-fac3f533dba5)
4. Adjust the tripod until you can see polaris through the side guide of the star adventurer body <br> ![IMG_4017](https://github.com/gabydaemon/StarAdventurer/assets/28716512/270542e1-06a2-4a18-8698-b09c6040f4b1)
5. Configure the 0 and 6 of the polar clock to be vertical
    1. Remove the polar scope cap
    1. Move the outermost dial on the body so that the white line is aligned with the 0 as shown in the photo <br> ![image](https://github.com/gabydaemon/StarAdventurer/assets/28716512/4cb46281-990b-4ab1-910e-42ac78d8987b)
